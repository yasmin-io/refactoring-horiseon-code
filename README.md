# Refactoring Horiseon Web Page

## Project Description

Horiseon requested me to refactor their web application code so it's optimized and follows accessibility standards. I was working with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) & [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) during this project and I used a variety of resources to help me prepare a plan for how to approach the tasks I was given.

> **Refactoring** is the systematic process of improving internal structure and existing code without changing the external behaviour. The functionality of the website would not change. By refactoring your website you are keeping a clean foundation, helping your websites upgradability and updatability for future developers who work with you or your company.

## Tasks

- Images include accessible `Alt` Tags for icons & images
- Update source code to semantic `HTML` elememts
- Organise code to have a logical structure
- Add Comments to the `HTML` & `CSS`
- Add a good title of the Web Page
- All heading attributes fall in sequential order

This project was a test of application of knowledge, problem solving and good initiative in making decisions.
